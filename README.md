## about the game

Game Objective:

  A single red LED circles around the CPX.  All other LEDs are yellow except for LED9, that is you.
  LED9 (you) is not lit until you press B (jump).
 
  As the red LED approaches, you must time your jump so that you avoid the red LED.
    If you are too early, the red LED will reach the end (completes a full circle) and this will be a 'hit' (no points).
    If you jump too late, you will know because your white LED will remain on after the CPX LED board has cleared (end of level)

  After you successfully or unsuccessfully jump the red LED, you may advance to the next level by pressing A.
  The CPX will say 'begin' and display which level you are currently on.

  Level 3 and above advances in difficulty as the red LED moves quicker, thus shortening your jump-window.


Strategy:

  Time your jump so that you jump the red LED right before it reaches you.

Level difficulty:

  Difficulty is increased at level 3 by the red LED increasing in speed.
